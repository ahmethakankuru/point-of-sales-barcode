# point-of-sales-barcode
It is a project developed using c# to be used in the sales process. There are all kinds of add-ons that a store can use in the process.
You must create a connection to the database from within visual studio. This project is a developed project. 
DarrenLee.Media is a third party plugin for barcode scanning and selling. 
You can activate the camera by pressing the F8 button on the cashier screen and perform the sales transaction by reading the barcodes to the camera. 
The barcode numbers of the products can be entered into the system manually and you can add the barcode created automatically here to the system, 
so you can read the barcode on the product.
